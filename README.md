# DES 228 Project Three: Festival
December 8, 2024

by Louella Mortel 

Hosted at: https://xluvly.github.io/projectThree/

# Project Overview

The festival project that I have created includes a fictional mental health, mainly focused on eating disorders, program called EmpowerED hosted at Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Eating disorders are not commonly taught about as well as having a lot of misconceptions, where even young kids can suffer from eating disorders. To educate the youth, this festival goes through many self-care practices, open panels with people sharing their stories, and learn how to find or give help.
